The Sinthgunt Converter is a graphical front end to the notoriously complex 
ffmpeg command line.

###################
# 2.0 INSTALLATION
###################

2.1 Linux(Ubuntu 8.10 or similar)

2.1.1 Requirements

Sinthgunt requires that you are running Linux, and that you have a working installation of python, pygtk and ffmpeg. On Ubuntu all you have to do is install ffmpeg by issuing the command 

    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

2.1.2 Installation
Download the latest source snapshot by issuing the command
    svn checkout http://sinthgunt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sinthgunt-read-only
Next, install sinthgunt by running the command

    python setup.py install

Now, run Sinthgunt by issuing the command
    
    sinthgunt.py

2.2 Windows 

Windows is not yet supported but ffmpeg, Python and GTK+ are available so 
maybe a future release of The Sinthgunt Converter will support Windows.

# 3.0 KNOWN ISSUS / TODO
###################

* The thumbnails are not generated for some files
* The configuration file should be in XML: name of operation,
  commando, preinput arguments, middle arguments,
  postoutput arguments, output filename extension 
  A huge collection of presets:
  http://code.google.com/p/winff/source/browse/trunk/%20winff%20--username%20bggmtt/presets.xml
* The input file selection dialog mime type should include more file types.
* Clean up of names like labelsovs to that is understandable and intuitive.  
* file_get_info uses flag=0 should be written pretty.
* How about a direct "Download youtube movie and convert to mp3 function"?
